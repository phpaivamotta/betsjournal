## About
This app was made with the intent of making it easier for users to manage their bets, create and improve on their betting strategy, and provide essential tools
in the betting process.

## Features
The users can log their bets, assign categories to them, edit them, and delete them. These bets can be found by using our Odds Comparison tool, which tracks and compares odds from multiple bookies; or our Value Bets tool, which finds amazing betting opportunities in soft bookie lines. The user can also perform common calculations, such as odd conversion, payout calculation, and margin calculation to make sure they are on top of their game.

After an account is created and bets have been placed, the user can see all of his bets in a neat and organized fashion. If he heads over to the Stats page, he can also see his betting statistics, whith plenty of graphs. This makes it easy to keep track of your bets and betting strategies, so that you can be absolutely sure of how much you are gaining or losing. 

We also offer API integration so that the user can integrate their application with ours! All that's needed is to create an account and generate an API key in the application, don't worry - it's all documented.

Also, anyone can subscribe to our Value Bets email service, which sends out a daily email with several value betting opportunities.

## Stack
This web app was created using the TALL stack (Tailwind, Alpine.js, Laravel, and Livewire).
